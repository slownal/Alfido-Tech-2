# Alfido-Tech-2 (Uber data Analysis)
In this project, we will use Python and its different libraries to analyze the Uber Rides Data.

Importing Libraries
The analysis will be done using the following libraries : 

Pandas:  This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy: Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: This library is used to draw visualizations.
